 # Food Delivery Website(Front end part)

This project is a front-end food delivery website developed using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Vite-Lite as the initial setup for a fast and optimized development environment. The website is designed to allow customers to easily browse through a menu, add items to their cart, and enter their address for delivery. Key React concepts such as useState, useContext, and useNavigate are utilized to efficiently manage state, context, and navigation within the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The home page features a well-structured and visually appealing layout, starting with a navbar that includes a logo and navigation links to Home, Menu, Mobile App, Contact, Cart, and a start icon. Below the navbar, there is a prominently styled main logo, created with special CSS techniques to stand out. Users can explore the menu through an interactive section that allows filtering of dishes, making it easy to find specific items. The full menu is displayed comprehensively, and there is also a dedicated section for mobile app downloads, encouraging users to install the app for a better experience. The footer provides additional links and information, ensuring that all necessary details are accessible.
